Kanto is a work in progress custom firmware for The Nintendo Switch 2 created by Team Rocket that unlocks the full potential of your console by using the Alola Exploter which alows you to use our installer to install customfirmware to your console over PCIe technology found in the Micro-SD Express slot of the console (for legal reasons Team Rocket will not sell you the device needed to acomplish this **That is up to you** also Team Rocket does not condone, support, fascilitate nor allow piracy on its platform and all assets are not associated with Nintendo and is fully open source and does not break and legal boudaries such as the DMCA or and laws alltogether if anyone associated with Team Rocket is found otherwise they will no longer be allowed on our platform) 

We are expected to have fully functioning software by the end of this year to show you but we kindly ask for you to be patient while we work away and do our magic and we are looking foward to having fully functional CFW ready for you very soon
